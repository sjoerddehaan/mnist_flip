# Playing a flipper game with MNIST
Some fun exercise building a image classifier with PyTorch.

### Flipped-MNIST dataset
Let's flip MNIST images at random, and train a classifier to detect flips. 

### Approach 1: Model and training with torch
Summary: Lot of work required for training a poor classifier (accuracy around 90% obtained)

### Approach 1: Model and training with Fast.ai
Summary: Easy to do, way better result (accuracy around 96%)
